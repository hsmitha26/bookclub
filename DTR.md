Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):

- Smitha: I am team player, I am looking forward to working with another team player and learning as much as possible. My collaboration style entails not being rigid, I like to work with people who are willing to change strategies based on what's needed to complete the project and achieve our individual goals also. I have a good grasp of the big picture and can help circle back, as needed.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
- Rene's experience, creativity and attention to details will be a great asset.  Smitha's big picture skills will hopefully help keep the project on track, when needed.
